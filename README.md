# Cancer-Prediction

Finding breast cancer early and getting state-of-the-art cancer treatment are two of the most important strategies for preventing deaths from breast cancer. Breast cancer that’s found early, when it’s small and has not spread, is easier to treat successfully. In this work we will apply a breast cancer classification with Logistic Regression algorithm, DT Algorithm and Random Forest Algorithm.
